## Who am I


I'm Jennifer Oenning, a full stack developer passionate about technology and design, with experience creating innovative solutions. I work on some technologies, always seeking to deliver high quality products and refined aesthetics.

## My Trajectory
My journey into the world of technology began with web development, where I fell in love with creating attractive and functional interfaces. When I was 14, I watched my brother program and was happy that he could solve problems for other people and close friends. That's where I was inspired to start college in 2019. I also had the opportunity to participate in the college's robotics group, where I got to have more experience with Arduino and go to school events to help kids understand what technology is like and how cool it can be.

## My Skills

* **My work environment**: Docker, Laradock.
* **Web Development**: Experience with frameworks such as Laravel, Vue, Node, React, MySQL, and tools such as Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material UI, Styled-Components, Jetstream, Livewire.
* **Design and Editing**: Ability to create interfaces and visual content using Figma, UI/UX, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Premiere, among others.
* **SoftSkills**: Ease of working in a group, ease of communication, time management, empathy and flexibility.

## How i learn

I'm learning some frameworks more in-depth like React and Node.

## What Motivates Me
Always seeking to learn and grow, whether by creating innovative technological solutions or sharing my routine on social media. My goal is to positively impact those who interact with my work, whether through efficient code, creative designs, or creating content for the internet!

## That's me ;D
